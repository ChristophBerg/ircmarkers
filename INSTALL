Installing IrcMarkers
---------------------

Debian:

	apt-get install ircmarkers

That will install IrcMarkers itself and its dependencies. The "gnupg" package
is optional (but will probably already be installed).


Other:

Get ircmarkers_x.y.tar.gz from

	http://www.df7cb.de/projects/ircmarkers/packages/

Unpack, build, and install it:

	tar xfz ircmarkers_x.y.tar.gz
	cd ircmarkers-x.y
	make
	make install

(Obviously, the last step needs to be executed as root.)

IrcMarkers requires the GD2 perl library to run. Check your OS's manual
on how to install that package. If you want to install it from source,
go to http://www.boutell.com/gd/.

If you want to use the "map of trust" feature, install GnuPG
(http://www.gnupg.org/).


Using IrcMarkers
----------------

You need a map in mercator or sinusoidal projection. A fine starting place is

The example.map file contains a short config file to get started with.
