  This program has been really inspired by two programs:

  * xplanet (http://xplanet.sourceforge.net).
  I have reused xplanet's overlap correction algorithm, and have ported it to
  C (which makes it quite faster than the C++ xplanet corrector).

  * Image::WorldMap (http://www.astray.com/WorldMap/) Author: LÃ©on Brocard
  The module API comes from this perl module.

The font provides with this package, fixed_01.ttf, has been created by the
Orgdot team, http://www.orgdot.com/aliasfonts/.
