Debian README for ircmarkers
============================

This package provides a TrueType font in /usr/share/ircmarkers/fixed_01.ttf.
Many other fonts are available in the ttf-* packages. Note that fixed_01.ttf
only supports a limited selection of unicode characters. If you are looking for
a replacement, /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-dejavu/DejaVuSansMono.ttf from
ttf-dejavu-core is a good choice.
