Description: place markers on maps at given coordinates
 IrcMarkers takes a map in .png or .jpg format and a list of coordinates and
 labels in xplanet format and places markers on the map. It was written to
 generate user maps of IRC channels. GnuPG/PGP key ids can be associated with
 each marker, to create "maps of trust".
